# Cypress Test Automation Project

Welcome to the Test Automation Project! This repository contains the code and resources necessary to automate quality tests in our software. Test automation allows us to ensure that our software functions reliably and smoothly as we make changes and improvements.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to establish a robust set of automated tests that cover critical functionalities of our application. This will enable us to:

- Detect and prevent regressions in the software.
- Ensure that new features are seamlessly integrated.
- Validate that the software meets specified requirements.

## Used Technologies

- **Cypress.io:** We use Cypress as our test automation tool. Cypress offers a user-friendly interface, a powerful API, and debugging capabilities that make creating and maintaining effective tests easy.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `tests/`: This folder contains all automated test cases.
- `support/`: Here you'll find support files such as helper functions and configurations.
- `plugins/`: Contains custom plugins for Cypress, if needed.
- `cypress.json`: Main Cypress configuration file.
- `README.md`: You're here! This file contains essential information about the project and how to use it.

## Environment Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. In the project's root folder, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Running Tests

1. Open a terminal in the project's root folder.
2. Run the `npm test` command to start the automated test suite.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you wish to enhance existing tests, add new test cases, or make any improvements, feel free to create a pull request. Be sure to follow coding best practices and adequately document your changes.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to get in touch with the development team through the usual channels.

With the guidance provided in this README, any team member can quickly understand the project's purpose, how to set up the environment, run tests, and contribute to the project. Remember that a good README is essential to foster collaboration and efficiency in development and test automation.
